      "question": "what is table header",
      "answer": "According to the provided context, a table header can be defined as the top row of a table, which is typically created using the <th> element. However, table headers can also be created using the <thead> element, which is a separate table header section.\n\nIn the code example provided, the table header is created using the <thead> element and contains a single row with two table data cells (<td>) that span across both columns using the colspan attribute.\n\nSo, to answer the question, a table header is the top section of a table that contains the column headers, which can be created using either the <th> element or the <thead> element."
